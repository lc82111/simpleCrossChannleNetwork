# simpleCrossChannleNetwork

This is a unoffice and simple implementation of NIPS2019 paper "Cross-channel Communication Networks"

If I'm right, it seems cross-channle module is another version of Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) block, because the attention is also a single scalar.

I hope I'm wrong about this.
